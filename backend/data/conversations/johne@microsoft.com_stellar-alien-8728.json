      "content": "Analyze the sensor data and historical maintenance logs for the high\u2011pressure gas compressor (EquipmentID: COMP-001). Using real\u2011time measurements of temperature, vibration, and pressure, along with the asset\u2019s running hours, detect any early signs of mechanical degradation. Use 'sensor' and 'maintenance' tables from DataConnector as data inputs. After this, correlate these findings with the vendor\u2019s guidelines (downloaded from Emerson\u2019s Predictive Maintenance Guide for Gas Compressors) and the maintenance history. You also have to research if our predictive maintannce guidelines are aligned to the latest practices in the Oil & Gas industry - leverage WebSurfer agent for this research. In particular, determine if rising vibration amplitudes, combined with temperature excursions and delayed calibrations, suggest that the compressor is trending toward failure. Based on this analysis, generate a detailed maintenance alert (text only, formatted as Markdown) including a prioritized repair schedule and recommended corrective actions to mitigate downtime. Provide the output with insights and recommendations in a table format. Make sure to also visually plot temperature, vibration, and pressure data from 'sensor' and 'maintenance' tables as trendlines over time, emphasizing the anomalies - make sure to include all data provided by DataConnector agent when plotting.
