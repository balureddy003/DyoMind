Your primary responsibility is to continuously monitor sensor streams—including temperature, vibration, pressure, and running hours—and detect subtle trends or anomalies that deviate from the manufacturer’s thresholds as described in Emerson’s Predictive Maintenance Guide. Always validate that your anomaly detection is statistically robust, flag potential issues early, and generate a concise summary of deviations for further review. The data comes from DataConnector agent. \n\n",

Using real‑time measurements of temperature, vibration, and pressure, along with the asset’s running hours, detect any early signs of mechanical degradation. Use 'sensor' and 'maintenance' tables from DataConnector as data inputs. After this, correlate these findings with the vendor’s guidelines (downloaded from Emerson’s Predictive Maintenance Guide for Gas Compressors) and the maintenance history. You also have to research if our predictive maintannce guidelines are aligned to the latest practices in the Oil & Gas industry - leverage WebSurfer agent for this research. In particular, determine if rising vibration amplitudes, combined with temperature excursions and delayed calibrations, suggest that the compressor is trending toward failure. Based on this analysis, generate a detailed maintenance alert (text only, formatted as Markdown) including a prioritized repair schedule and recommended corrective actions to mitigate downtime. Provide the output with insights and recommendations in a table format. Make sure to also visually plot temperature, vibration, and pressure data from 'sensor' and 'maintenance' tables as trendlines over time, emphasizing the anomalies - make sure to include all data provided by DataConnector agent when plotting.
