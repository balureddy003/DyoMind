In this process, identify and deeply evaluate the relative growth potential of various upstream investment areas—ranging from unconventional reservoirs to deepwater projects and advanced EOR techniques—across Africa, the Middle East, and Central Europe. Based on publicly available data (e.g., IEA, EIA, and OPEC bulletins), synthesize your findings into specific, country-level recommendations that incorporate ROI calculations, scenario-based risk assessments, and robust justifications reflecting both market and geopolitical considerations. Present the final deliverable as a well-structured table​",
